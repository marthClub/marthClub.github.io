      <i>Achilles:</i>
      Good day, Ms. Tortoise!
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      Hello Achilles! Wonderful to see you.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      And you as well. Thank you for meeting with me to talk about learning coding.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      It's my pleasure! I think it's something you'll find quite interesting. You're a very creative fellow, and it could be another way for you to express that creativity.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      I am very interested. I've seen some of the "MARTH" that you've created, and it's really cool. But I have to say, I'm a little nervous about diving into this.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      I understand. A lot of people get nervous when they try something new.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      Indeed! But it's not just that. Computer programming seems really, well, <i>difficult</i>. I'm just not sure that I have what it takes to learn it.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      Well, coding is a skill. And like all skills, it will take time to develop. The real question is not whether you <i>can</i> do it, but whether you will <i>enjoy</i> doing it. Anyone can learn coding at a basic level. Some people may find they just don't like it. Others get started and find it fun. If you enjoy it, you'll learn very quickly. You never know until you try it, though.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      I take it you enjoy coding?
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      I do. I see it as a continuously evolving puzzle. I get an idea for something I want to make, and I start working on it. Once I figure out how to get my idea working, I usually start coming up with ideas to make it even more interesting. Then I have to figure out how to get those ideas working. Every step along the way I learn new things, which give me even more ideas.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      That does sound kind of fun. And you really think I can do it?
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      Of course you can, and I'll do my best to help you to get started.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      How long did it take you to become an expert at coding?
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      Oh, I'm no expert! Not by a long stretch. I'm just learning myself. If you get into coding you'll find that there is so much to learn. But don't let that scare you. I find it exciting to know that there are always new ways to challenge myself.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      I see. Well, how long will it take me to actually make something that works and does something?
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      Not long at all. If you want, we can get together some time, and I'll go over some basics with you. It will take about an hour or so to get you started and running your first program.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      That doesn't sound bad at all. So, how will it work? Are you going to explain a bunch of stuff to me while I take notes?
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      No, no. The best way to learn coding is by doing it. We'll just sit down and get started. There are a few things we'll need to do to get set up, and that will take a little while. But you'll only have to do that once, and I'll walk you through it step-by-step. The setup will take about half an hour. Then we'll jump right into making an interactive webpage.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      That sounds cool. How long will it take to make that?
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      A matter of minutes.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      Really?
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      Really. And it will be your own webpage that you can share with the world.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      Whoa! That sounds really cool. And you'll help me the whole way through?
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      I'll help you get your basic program set up, yes. But after that, I'm going to challenge you to start changing it to make it your own unique work of art. I'll give you some simple things you can try, and you'll start experimenting. After that, you'll probably want me to leave you alone so you can play. And then you'll be off and running!
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      That sounds really fast. I mean, I like fast. I am fast. But less than an hour to get me to the point that I'm programming on my own? That sounds impossible.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      Give me a chance, and I'll show you it is indeed possible.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      OK. I'm sold. Let's do this.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      Right now?
    </p>
    <p style="color:#0019bc; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Achilles:</i>
      There's no time like the present.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#018c18; text-indent:-63px; margin-left:63px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
      <i>Tortoise:</i>
      I like your enthusiasm. OK. If you're ready, go ahead and follow the link at the bottom of this page we're on, and we'll get started.

    <b>Setting up your Chromebook or other device for local development (independent from GitHub).</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Pros</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Changes you make will be reflected instantly instead of having to wait for GitHub commits to take effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Caret editor is superior to the online editor in GitHub in many ways.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use "undo" in the Caret app to backtrack if you accidentally screw something up in your code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Cons</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your project will only run on your own device. It won't be live on the internet for everyone to see. (However, you can very easily upload your sketch.js file to a web-enabled GitHub repository later)

      </ul>
      <li>Steps:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download and launch the two apps (Caret and WSfC).
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on each of the three "Blank Sketch" Links to download them. Locate the files in your "Downloads" folder, and move them to another folder on your device or in your Google Drive.
        </li>
        <li>
          In WSfC, click "CHOOSE FOLDER", and navigate to the folder where you stored the "Blank Sketch" files. Click "OK".
        </li>
        <li>
          In WSfC, click the blue link under "Web Server URL(s)". This will open the directory in your browser. Click the "index.html" to open your sketch. Note that it will just be a blank page until you put some code in the sketch.js file.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Caret, open the sketch.js file, and put in some code. Save using the menu, or press Ctrl-S.
        </li>
        <li>
          In your browser, refresh the webpage to see the changes. Repeat these last two steps until you've made something awesome!
        </li>

    Setting up your Chromebook or other device for local development (independent from GitHub).
    <ul>
      <li>Pros</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Changes you make will be reflected instantly instead of having to wait for GitHub commits to take effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Caret editor is superior to the online editor in GitHub in many ways.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use "undo" in the Caret app to backtrack if you accidentally screw something up in your code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Cons</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your project will only run on your own device. It won't be live on the internet for everyone to see. (However, you can very easily upload your sketch.js file to a web-enabled GitHub repository later)

      </ul>
      <li>Steps:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download and launch the two apps (Caret and WSfC).
        </li>
        <li>
          Download the files in the "Blank Sketch" shared folder. It is recommended that you create a folder on your device or your Google Drive to store these in.
        </li>
        <li>
          In WSfC, click "CHOOSE FOLDER", and navigate to the folder where you stored the "Blank Sketch" files. Click "OK".
        </li>
        <li>
          In WSfC, click the blue link under "Web Server URL(s)". This will open the directory in your browser. Click the "index.html" to open your sketch. Note that it will just be a blank page until you put some code in the sketch.js file.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Caret, open the sketch.js file, and put in some code. Save using the menu, or press Ctrl-S.
        </li>
        <li>
          In your browser, refresh the webpage to see the changes. Repeat these last two steps until you've made something awesome!
